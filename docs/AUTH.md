# Smart Village App Auth Documentation

You can find the documentation of the app's auth implementation here.

## Secrets

You need to provide necessary credentials per secrets-File in
[/src/config](../src/config) to be able to fetch data from the server.

You can use the [example file](../src/config/secrets.temp) with the keys needed.
Change the file extension from `.temp` to `.js`, remove the comment and enter your data.
The js-file needs to be listed in the [.gitignore](../.gitignore) file.
